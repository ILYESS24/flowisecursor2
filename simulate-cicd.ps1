# Flowise Security Scan Report

Generated on: $(Get-Date)

## Summary

This report contains the results of a comprehensive security and quality analysis of the Flowise project.

## Security Audit Results

- npm audit: $(if (Test-Path "audit-results.json") { "Completed" } else { "Failed" })
- pnpm audit: Completed
- Docker security: $(if (-not $SkipDocker) { "Completed" } else { "Skipped (Docker not available)" })

## Code Quality Results

- ESLint: Completed
- Prettier: Completed  
- TypeScript: Completed

## Build and Test Results

- Build: Completed
- Tests: Completed
- Coverage: Completed

## Performance Results

- Load tests: $(if (Test-Path "artillery-load-test.yml") { "Completed" } else { "Skipped (No config)" })

## Recommendations

1. **Review Security Issues**: Check audit-results.json for detailed vulnerability information
2. **Update Dependencies**: Address any outdated packages found
3. **Fix Code Quality Issues**: Resolve ESLint and Prettier warnings
4. **Improve Test Coverage**: Aim for higher test coverage
5. **Monitor Performance**: Set up continuous performance monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Review all generated reports
2. Fix identified issues
3. Update dependencies
4. Improve test coverage
5. Set up automated security scanning
